# Task 8: VPN Setup & Browser Security

##  Description
This project demonstrates how to use a free VPN (ProtonVPN) to enhance online privacy and secure internet communication. It also includes steps to identify and remove suspicious browser extensions to improve browser safety.

## Tools Used
- ProtonVPN (Free tier)
- Browser (Chrome)
- https://whatismyipaddress.com (for IP check)

##  Task Steps
1. Signed up for a ProtonVPN free account.
2. Installed the VPN client and connected to the nearest server.
3. Verified IP address change using whatismyipaddress.com.
4. Browsed websites to confirm encrypted connection.
5. Disconnected VPN and noted differences in speed and IP.
6. Reviewed browser extensions and removed suspicious ones.

##  VPN Benefits
- Hides real IP and location
- Encrypts traffic for better privacy
- Helps stay safe on public Wi-Fi

##  VPN Limitations
- Free VPNs may have slower speeds
- Doesnâ€™t block viruses or phishing directly
- Some websites block VPN connections

## Screenshot
_A screenshot showing the VPN connection status and IP address change should be added here._
